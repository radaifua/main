Pelion, the legendary mountain of the Centaurs, is an amazing combination of sea and mountain landscape, which rises imposing northeast of Volos. It is a tourist destination throughout the year, having a dense network of trails for hiking and coves with small or large beaches with sand or pebbles. Pelion there are over 40 villages and settlements built in the traditional Pelion architecture. Some are more graphics, but is more agricultural and less developed tourist, some are inaccessible, others are more mansions and rich, some are older, built in a commanding slopes that pull away from the attention and admiration of travelers, while some others are small and shy and prefer to remain invisible, hidden within the lush vegetation.
